## Setups

| Badge | Name | Signal |
|-------|------|--------|
| **EP** | Episodic Pivot | Catalyst gap/surge ≥5% on ≥2× avg volume; tight consolidation follows; entry on breakout above EP high |
| **TB** | Tight Base | Flat base ≤8–10% range, resistance retested ≥2×, volume breakout; base can be 2 weeks to 5 years |
| **VCP** | Volatility Contraction Pattern | Minervini's signature: ≥2 progressively tighter pullbacks + volume dry-up, in an uptrend; breakout above the pivot (final-contraction high) |
| **PP** | Pocket Pivot | Up-day volume exceeds the highest down-day volume in the prior 10 days, above 10-day MA, EMA21 > EMA50 |
| **PULL** | EMA Pullback | Stage 2 uptrend (EMA21 > EMA50, rising), price touched EMA21 in last 1–5 bars, RSI 38–68 |
| **FBD** | Failed Breakdown | Price breaks below support 0.4–6%, snaps back above within 1–3 bars; trapped shorts fuel the reversal |
| **WYS** | Wyckoff Spring | Shakeout ≤3% below a tight accumulation range (15% range, 40 bars), snap-back within 3 bars; highest-conviction bear trap |

Each result shows: **Entry · Stop · T1 · T2 · R:R · RS · P Grade + P Score · Setup · Risk% · Weinstein Stage · A/D Net · Weekly direction**

> **EP targets** are a measured move projected from the **entry**, not the historical EP-day close: `T1 = entry + 1× (ep_close − prior_close)`, `T2 = entry + 2× (ep_close − prior_close)`. Anchoring to the old pivot close used to yield targets below entry (negative R:R) after a stock had already run up; every detector now rejects setups where `entry ≤ stop` or `target ≤ entry` so R:R is always meaningful.

### Data
- **Primary source:** [Alpaca Markets](https://alpaca.markets) free paper trading API — works on cloud hosts (200 req/min)
- **Rate limiting:** `threading.Semaphore(4)` + exponential backoff with full jitter + 429 Retry-After handling + 4 retries
- **S&P 500 constituents:** Fetched from [datasets/s-and-p-500-companies](https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies) GitHub CSV, cached 24 hours, falls back to hardcoded 100-stock sample
- **All US universe:** Alpaca `/v2/assets` endpoint, cached 24 hours; falls back to 1,000+ curated static list

### Market Positioning (forward-looking regime layer)
- **CFTC COT** — leveraged-funds (hedge fund / CTA proxy) net position in E-mini S&P 500 + Nasdaq futures, z-scored vs ~3 years (free Socrata API, weekly)
- **SPY put/call ratio** — computed from Alpaca options data across near-dated expirations (daily); fear ≥2.0 / complacency ≤1.1
- **NAAIM Exposure Index** — active-manager equity exposure scraped from naaim.org (weekly); washed-out <30 / fully-invested >90
- **Contrarian regime dial** — each source votes at extremes (fear = +1, crowded = −1); dial −3…+3 shown on the Dashboard as a sizing/aggression gate. Cached 12h. `GET /market/positioning`
- **Market breadth** — leading "momentum environment" gauge over a ~100-name large-cap sample: % above 50/200-DMA, new highs−lows, advance/decline, a 0–100 breadth score + state (strong → risk-off), and a **divergence flag** (SPY near highs but breadth thin = narrowing advance). Plain-English read on the Dashboard. Cached 6h. `GET /market/breadth`

### Frontend
- **Analyze page** — Deep-dive for any individual stock: all 7 setups, RSI/MACD/ADX, MA stack, Weinstein stage, ICS, A/D Net, 10-item signal checklist (incl. Minervini Trend Template), Minervini Trend Template criteria card, a **"Why this score" per-driver P Score breakdown** (plain-English bullets — what's pushing the grade up/down, conviction, regime, penalty), early warnings, **multi-timeframe alignment** (daily + weekly + monthly, no extra API calls), and a **Fibonacci grid** (retracement ladder + golden pocket + extension targets, anchored to the dominant ~6-month swing)
- **Fibonacci grid** — Auto-anchored to the dominant swing in the last ~120 bars (absolute high & low, ordered by time → no arbitrary anchoring). Reports the retracement ladder (23.6/38.2/50/61.8/78.6 %), the **golden pocket** (61.8–65 %), extension targets (127.2/161.8/200/261.8 %), and where current price sits (retrace depth, nearest level). It is a **confluence map, not a score input** — see the `/scoring` page for the reasoning
- **Options (leading)** — Per-symbol forward-looking layer from the near-dated chain (≤45d): **ATM implied volatility**, **IV Rank** (IBKR-style IV ÷ 30-day realised vol → options rich/cheap), the options-implied **expected move** (± % / ± $ by expiry, for sizing catalyst targets/stops; expiry selection skips <7-DTE weeklies and anchors to the ~30-day monthly horizon so the move is swing-relevant, not a 3-day scalp), **skew** (OTM put IV − call IV → hedging vs demand), put/call **volume** & **open-interest** ratios, an **unusual-activity** flag (volume ÷ OI), **max pain** (OI-weighted pin price + distance from spot), the **ACI level** (delta-adjusted-OI sentiment — Black-Scholes-Δ-weighted bullish vs bearish OI, from each snapshot), **OI-derived support/resistance** (put walls below / call walls above), **dealer gamma exposure (GEX)** with the zero-gamma flip + gamma walls (positive = pinning/mean-reversion, negative = move amplification), and **IV term structure** (front-expiry vs ~45-day ATM IV → backwardation = an imminent event/catalyst is priced in). Each metric has a hover tooltip explaining it, and the card shows a **per-stock plain-English interpretation** that reads the metrics together (IV vs realized, the swing band from the expected move, skew/flow direction, OI positioning) — the analyst read, generated server-side (no API cost). Options price *expectations*, so they genuinely lead — but it's a **context/confluence layer, not a P Score input**. **Data source (auto-fallback chain):** (1) **CBOE delayed-quotes CDN** — free, no key, full chain incl. OI + IV + greeks, datacenter-friendly so it works on Render; (2) **yfinance** — full chain but blocked on cloud IPs; (3) **Alpaca** snapshots — quotes only (IV via Black-Scholes inversion, OI-based metrics unavailable). First source that succeeds wins; the `source` field shows which. CBOE is the preferred source and gives the full card (incl. max pain / ACI / OI walls) on the live site
- **Backtester** — No-lookahead, event-driven validation of the setup detectors (`scanner/backtester.py`, CLI). Full metric battery + bull/bear & per-year splits + an overfitting gate that requires edge in *every* sub-period. See the [Backtesting](#backtesting) section
- **Dashboard** — Market Positioning panel (regime dial), scan controls, advanced filter panel, stats bar (Total / Grade A / EPs), full results table
- **Setup pages** — Deep-dive educational pages for EP, TB, VCP, PP, PULL, and FBD with ASCII charts, criteria, comparison tables, and entry/stop rules
- **Scanner signals guide** — Plain-English explanation of Weinstein Stage, A/D Net, Quality Score, and Overextension Penalty on the Setups hub page
- **Scoring page** — Full algorithm reasoning: every formula, every weight, every threshold, and the WHY behind each design decision
- **Watchlist** — Persistent per-symbol list scanned separately
- **Email settings** — Test SMTP config and trigger manual digests from the UI
- **Light mode forced** — Consistent UI regardless of OS dark mode preference

## Scanner Signal Reference

These signals appear in every scan result and help filter the highest-quality setups.

### Weinstein Stage (Stg column)

Classifies each stock into one of Stan Weinstein's four stages using the 30-week (150-bar) moving average:

| Badge | Stage | Condition | Action |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| S1 | Basing | Flat MA, price at/below MA | Wait |
| S2 | Advancing | Rising MA, price above MA | **Trade here** |
| S3 | Topping | MA rolling over after advance | Avoid new longs |
| S4 | Declining | Falling MA, price below MA | Short only |

### A/D Net (A/D column)

O'Neill-style institutional accumulation/distribution count over the last 25 bars:
- **Accumulation day:** close up >=0.2% vs prior, volume > prior bar, close in upper 50% of the day's range
- **Distribution day:** close down >=0.2% vs prior, volume > prior bar
- **Net = acc days - dist days.** Positive = institutions buying. Negative = distributing.

### Overextension Penalty

When RSI > 80 or price is >8% above EMA21, a penalty is applied to the confidence score:
- RSI penalty: `(RSI - 80) x 0.5 pts` per RSI point above 80
- EMA21 extension penalty: up to 10 pts when price > 8% above EMA21
- Maximum total penalty: 20 pts. Shown as "Overextended (-Xpts)" in the notes column.

### Scoring: P Score (the single score) + Qullamaggie setups

Every scan result and analysis carries one score — the **P Score** — plus a flag for which Qullamaggie
**setup** (if any) is firing. The P Score answers *"how strong is the overall evidence?"*; the setup
defines *"what kind of entry is this?"* (and supplies the entry / stop / targets).

| | Formula | Grade thresholds | What it measures |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **P Score** | `Σ (strength × weight × accuracy × regime_mult)` + weekly-TF adj − penalties | A≥75 / B≥60 / C≥45 / D<45 | Probability-weighted signal voting across up to 20 independent signals |
| **Setup** | detector-defined (EP / TB / WYS / PP / PULL / FBD) | — | Whether a tradeable Qullamaggie entry exists right now |

> **Note:** an earlier version also showed a separate fixed "Q Score" (`quality×60 + RS×25 + stage×10 + A/D×5`).
> It was retired to avoid two competing numbers — its ingredients (RS, Weinstein stage, A/D, the firing
> setup pattern, and stop tightness via detector confidence) all live on as weighted signals inside the P Score.
> Scan results sort by P Score and the `min_score` filter applies to it.

Full algorithm reasoning (formulas, weights, thresholds, rationale) on the **[/scoring page](https://qmag-platform-1.onrender.com/scoring)** of the live site.

#### P Score — Probability Scorer

Ported from the `technical-analysis` reference repo. Each signal contributes: `strength × weight × accuracy × regime_multiplier`. Regime is inferred from Weinstein stage (S2=trend, S4=range, else transition). Agreement bonus of ×1.2 applied when ≥70% of signals agree. A weekly-timeframe adjustment (+7.5 bullish/S2 … −6.0 bearish) and overextension penalties are applied after the vote.

**Anti-top-trap gate:** the weekly is a lagging signal that stays bullish after the daily rolls over (the signature of a local top). So the bullish weekly bonus only applies at full strength when the **daily vote is also bullish**; when the daily is neutral it is scaled ×0.2 (e.g. +7.5 → +1.5). The bearish-weekly penalty is never scaled.

**Local-top / distribution penalty** (post-vote, long/neutral only, capped −8): docks points when a name shows topping behaviour even while still technically long — ≥3 distribution days in 10 (−3), MACD histogram fading at highs (−2), bearish RSI divergence (−3).

```
Setup patterns:  EP (w=3.0 acc=72%), WYS (3.0/75%), VCP (2.8/72%),
                 TB (2.5/70%), FBD (2.0/68%), PP (2.0/65%), PULL (1.5/63%)
Trend/momentum:  Stage (2.5/72%), Minervini Trend Template (1.8/72%),
                 EMA stack (1.5/70%), OBV (1.5/65%), CMF (1.2/64%),
                 ICS (1.2/68%), Supertrend (1.0/68%), MACD (1.0/65%),
                 A/D Net (1.0/65%), Keltner Channels (0.85/63%)
Mean-reversion:  RSI (1.0/62%), Bollinger %B (0.85/62%), Stochastic (0.8/61%)
Post-vote:       Weekly-TF adjustment, overextension penalty

P grade: A≥75 / B≥60 / C≥45 / D<45
```

The **Minervini Trend Template** is Mark Minervini's 8-point SEPA leadership filter (price vs SMA 50/150/200, 200-SMA rising, 52-week price position, RS ≥ 70). Its strength = fraction of the 8 criteria met; the live count appears in the Analyze-page signal tooltip.

**P Grade A + a firing setup:** Maximum conviction — size up.
**P Grade A but no setup firing:** Strong trend, no clean entry yet — add to watchlist and wait for a trigger.
**Low P Grade + a firing setup:** Entry exists but evidence is weak/mixed — reduce size or pass; check the Analyzer page signal breakdown.

Because RS, Weinstein stage, and the firing setup are high-weight P Score signals, a great pattern in a weak-RS or non-Stage-2 stock still **cannot** reach P Grade A — intentional. Qullamaggie only trades Stage 2 leaders with strong RS.

## Email Digest

### Manual send

```bash
cd backend
python daily_digest.py                              # S&P 500, top 20
python daily_digest.py --universe nasdaq100         # Nasdaq 100 only
python daily_digest.py --setup ep --min-rs 70       # EP setups, RS >= 70
python daily_digest.py --universe all --top 30      # All US, top 30
```

### Automated daily routine

A scheduled routine runs every weekday at **7:00 AM ET** via the Claude Code `/schedule` skill. It scans the S&P 500 (top 20, min RS 50) and emails the digest automatically.

To reconfigure the schedule, run `/schedule` in Claude Code and update the existing routine.

---

## Backtesting

`scanner/backtester.py` is an **event-driven, no-lookahead** backtester that validates whether the setup detectors actually have forward edge. At every bar a detector only ever sees data up to that bar (`df.iloc[:i+1]`); fills are at the signal-bar close.

```bash
cd backend
python -m scanner.backtester --symbols NVDA,AMD,META,AAPL,MSFT,TSLA --start 2022-01-01 --end 2025-04-30 --hold 20
python -m scanner.backtester --symbols NVTS,GLXY,LAC --json   # full JSON incl. per-trade records
```

**Methodology** (adapted from an IBKR-style backtest writeup):
- **Deliberate window** — default 2022-01-01 → 2025-04-30: two bear markets + a low-vol and a high-vol bull run, so results aren't regime-cherry-picked (and it excludes the post-COVID "helicopter money" distortion).
- **Two exit policies per signal** — a fixed N-day calendar hold **and** the detector's own stop/target — to see whether active management helps.
- **Metric battery** — win rate (by trade & by month), reward:risk, expectancy, $1k-per-trade total, Sharpe & Sortino (per-trade), max drawdown, win/loss streaks, **"win 3 of 4" probability**, alpha vs SPY.
- **Overfitting guard** — every metric is reported for the whole window **and** split by regime (bull/bear) and by calendar year; a setup only **passes** the gate if it clears the bar (≥10% annualised, ≥55% monthly win rate, drawdown under cap) in *every* sub-period, with ≥20 trades.

**First run (12 liquid names, 344 trades, 2022→2025):** TP/SL beat fixed-hold on win rate for most setups (e.g. FBD 58%→71%, PP 62%→74%), but **no setup passed the all-sub-period gate** — they earn strongly in the 2023–24 bull and bleed in the 2022 bear. That regime-dependence is exactly what the gate is designed to surface; an aggregate-only view would have looked like "edge."

> ⚠️ The **annualised / cumulative** figures assume sequential single-position reinvestment, so they massively overstate returns when trades overlap across symbols (e.g. 2023's "+72,000%" is an artifact). Trust **win rate, reward:risk, expectancy, Sharpe, and max drawdown**; TP/SL is the realistic exit lens. A Phase-2 **portfolio equity curve** (shared capital, position sizing) is needed for a trustworthy annualised/Sharpe number, plus an `/backtest` endpoint + page and validation of the P Score / options / Fibonacci layers.

---

## RS Score

IBD-style Relative Strength score (0-100) versus SPY:

```
RS = 40% x (3m perf ratio) + 20% x (6m) + 20% x (9m) + 20% x (12m)
     mapped to 0-100 (50 = matches SPY, 100 = maximum outperformance)
```

| Score | Label |
|-------|-------|
| >= 90 | RS Elite |
| >= 75 | RS Strong |
| >= 50 | RS Average |
| >= 25 | RS Weak |
| < 25 | RS Laggard |

Use `min_rs=70` (or the slider) to filter to stocks clearly outperforming the market.
